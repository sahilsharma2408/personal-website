export const bio = [
  "I'm a Frontend Architect with 5+ years of experience spearheading 0→1 solutions at scale. I specialise in design systems — having built 50+ component libraries that boosted dev productivity by 30% — and in performance engineering, where I've driven 60% bundle size reductions and 40% faster build times.",
  "My architectural work spans micro-frontend platforms (Webpack 5 Module Federation), monorepos (Turborepo/Lerna), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — bridging design systems with AI dev environments via executable knowledge bases. I'm deeply invested in CI/CD automation, analytics integration (Sentry/Segment), and developer experience tooling that makes teams fast and keeps engineers happy.",
  "I enjoy sharing what I learn — through technical writing (5K+ readers), conference talks, and open-source work. The best software comes from teams that invest in their craft, and I'm always looking for ways to make the development process faster, safer, and more enjoyable.",
